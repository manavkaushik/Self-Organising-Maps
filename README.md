# Self-Organising-Maps


A Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that is trained using unsupervised and competitive learning to produce low dimensional, discretized representation of presented high dimensional data, while simultaneously preserving similarity relations between the presented data items. Such low dimensional representation is called a feature map.SOMs map multidimensional data onto lower-dimensional subspaces where geometric relationships between points indicate their similarity and are therefore used in dimensionality reduction, data visualization, and clustering. Self-organizing maps differ from other artificial neural networks as they apply competitive learning(winner takes all) as opposed to error-correction learning for updating its weight. SOM is a grid of neurons that each contain a weight vector of the same dimensionality as the input vector. <br/><br/>
